- [fantasy-land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land)
- [static-land](https://github.com/rpominov/static-land)
- PureScript
- Scala

The idea (faking higher kinded types in TypeScript) is based on the paper [Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf), [elm-brands](https://github.com/joneshf/elm-brands) and [flow-static-land](https://github.com/gcanti/flow-static-land).
